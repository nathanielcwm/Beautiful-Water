    <description>Changes water tiles from their neutral 0 beauty value, to:

  * Shallow Water - 1
  * Shallow Moving Water - 1
  * Chest-Deep Moving Water - 5 or 15 ††
  * Shallow Ocean Water - 5
  * Deep Ocean Water - 20†
  * Deep Water - 15†
  
Footnotes: 
†
Water that you can't walk in is treated as a wall by the game, and therefore the beauty for these tiles only goes to a depth of 1.
††
There are mods that make Chest-Deep Moving Water impassable. If they are installed the beauty is bumped to 15.
